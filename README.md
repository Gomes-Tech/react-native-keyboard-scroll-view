Here is a description for your `KeyboardScrollView` library on npmjs:

---

## KeyboardScrollView

**KeyboardScrollView** is a library for **React Native** that provides a practical solution for managing keyboard visibility on screens with text input fields. It automatically adjusts the screen content, ensuring that text fields remain visible when the keyboard is displayed, facilitating form navigation and other interactions with inputs.

### Features

- **Compatible with iOS and Android**: Custom behaviors for each platform ensure a consistent experience across both.
- **Automatic scroll adjustment**: When the keyboard opens, the content automatically scrolls so the focused text field stays visible.
- **Customizable additional scroll height**: Add extra space above the keyboard using the `additionalScrollHeight` property.
- **Full ScrollView support**: The component is based on React Native's `ScrollView` and retains all of its original functionalities.
- **Seamless integration**: Easy to integrate into any React Native app.

### Installation

```bash
npm install react-native-keyboard-scroll-view
```

```bash
yarn add react-native-keyboard-scroll-view
```

### Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, Text } from 'react-native';
import KeyboardScrollView from 'react-native-keyboard-scroll-view';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <KeyboardScrollView additionalScrollHeight={20}>
      <View>
        <TextInput placeholder="Enter your name" />
        <TextInput placeholder="Enter your email" />
        <Text>Other content</Text>
      </View>
    </KeyboardScrollView>
  );
};

export default App;
```
